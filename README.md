HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING

Human activity recognition is a crucial aspect of modern medicine, as it allows healthcare professionals to track and monitor the physical activity patterns of their patients.This report aims to improve the
classification of human activity time series data using deep learning techniques. A dataset of time
series data collected using a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone was used. Different model architectures,
such as CNNs and LSTMs, were evaluated and the best results were obtained using an LSTM model .
However, the computation time for the LSTM model was higher compared to CNNs. Additionally, the
performance on the underrepresented labels in the dataset was poor and transfer learning techniques
were unsuccessful in addressing this issue.
